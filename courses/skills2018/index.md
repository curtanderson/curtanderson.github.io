Three pass approach to reading papers.

Contrasts with starting at the beginning and working to the end.

1: Bird's eye view of the paper

- 5 to 10 minutes
- Steps
	1. Read title, abstract, introduction
	2. Read the section and sub-section headings, ignore everything else
	3. Glance at mathematical content to determine theoretical foundations
	4. Read conclusions
	5. Glance over references, noting anything you've already read

- Should be able to answer these questions at the end of the first pass:
	1. Category: What type of paper is it? (Measurement, analysis, description, etc...)
	2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
	3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
	4. Contributions: What are the paper's main contributions?
	5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

Possible you might not care about the paper after this (not interesting, not accessible to you, stupid assumptions).

Expect your readers to only make one pass over a paper!

- Choose coherent section and sub-section titles
- Write concise and comprehensive abstracts

2: Read the paper with greater care, but ignore details like proofs

- Jot down key points
- Make notes in margins
- Make note of questions you would ask author
- Note terms you don't understand
- Other stuff
	1. Look carefully at figures, diagrams, illustrations, graphs. Are they properly labeled? Have error bars? Sloppy v. careful work
	2. Mark relevant unread references for further reading
- This should take an hour for an experienced reader
- Should be able to summarize main idea, with evidence.

3: Attempting to recreate the paper

- Attention to detail!
- Understand completely the authors' assumptions and how they get to their conclusions.
- Challenge every statement.
- Compare their approach to what you would do.
- Many hours
- Be able to pinpoint problems, missing assumptions, missing lit, problems with experiments, etc

Three pass method for doing a lit review:

- Use Google Scholar, CiteSeer, or something else to find 3-5 recent highly-cited papers in an area (choose keywords carefully)
- Do one pass on each paper to get a sense of the work, then read related work sections. You might even get lucky and get a pointer on a survey paper.
- Second, find shared ciations and repeated author names. These are the key papers and researchers. Download the papers. Go to authors' websites and see what they've published recently, and where. Go to these venues (conferences is what author discusses here, but journal is good too).
- Third, go to website for venue and look through recent issues/proceedings. Identify related work.
- These papers, plus the ones from earlier, are the first version of your survey. Make two passes through these, and get any key papers you missed.
