				<h3>About Me</h3>

				<p>Hi, I'm Curt Anderson. I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher with <a href="http://www.sfb991.uni-duesseldorf.de/en/the-structure-of-representations-in-language-cognition-and-science/">CRC 991 at Heinrich Heine Universität Düsseldorf</a>, where I am supervised by Sebastian Löbner and Wiebke Petersen. I am investigating the mechanisms of composition involved with attributive adjectives and the nominals they modify (see <a href="http://www.sfb991.uni-duesseldorf.de/en/c10/">the project page</a> for more information).</p>

				<p>I completed my PhD in Linguistics at Michigan State University in May 2016. In my <a href="work/dissertation.pdf">dissertation</a> I examined intensification and attenuation in English through the lens of exclamatives, approximation, and slack regulation. My work at MSU was supervised by <a href="http://www.msu.edu/~morzycki/">Marcin Morzycki</a>.</p>

				<p>Broadly speaking, I'm interested primarily in linguistic meaning, how it is structured, and how it is acquired. Currently, I'm involved in work at Heinrich Heine Universität examining the compositional interaction of adjectives and nouns. Previous projects of mine looked at the use of modifiers that allow approximate meanings to arise, non-canonical uses of <i>some</i> in exclamative constructions and approximation, and children's understanding of telicity.</p>

						<p class="abstract">This paper argues that a variety of constructions in a variety of languages suggest a deep connection between kinds, manners, and degrees. We articulate a way of thinking about degrees on which this connection is less surprising, rooted in the idea that degrees are kinds of Davidsonian states. This enables us to provide a cross-categorial compositional semantics for a class of expressions that can serve as anaphors to kinds, manners, and degrees, or introduce clauses that further characterize them. A consequence of this is that equatives emerge as a special case of a more general cross-categorial phenomenon. The analysis is undergirded by independently motivated assumptions about free relatives and type shifting. It provides evidence for a view of degrees on which they are significantly more ontologically complex than is typically thought.</p>

Brain and Language. (with Matthew Whelpton, Drew Trotter, Þórhalla Guðmundsdóttir Beck, Joan Maling, Karthik Durvasula, and Alan Beretta.)

						<p class="abstract">An ERP study investigated the processing of mass nouns used to convey ‘portions’ vs. ‘sorts’ interpretations in Icelandic. The sorts interpretation requires semantic Coercion to a count noun; the portions interpretation entails extra syntactic processing. Compared to a Neutral condition, Coercion escaped the expected penalty (N400), but the Extra Syntax condition incurred the anticipated costs (anterior negativity followed by P600).

						Furthermore, we examined the effects of having to revise an initial commitment to head-noun status. When another noun follows the mass noun (creating a compound), the second noun becomes the head-noun. We hypothesized, for Icelandic, there would be no effect for Extra Syntax because the compound should have been built before the second noun was encountered; by contrast, for the Coercion and Neutral conditions, processing costs would be incurred to detect and reconfigure the second noun as the head. These predictions were largely borne out (early and sustained anterior negativities).

						<p class="abstract">In this paper I investigate a use of the English determiner <i>some</i> with numerals, as in <i>twenty-some</i>. This kind of construction has an approximative interpretation, where it is interpreted as denoting a number within a range. <i>Some</i> cannot modify all numerals, with constraints that depend on the syntactic structure of the numeral. I draw parallels between this construction and epistemic indefinites, and provide an analysis based on existing analyses of Spanish <i>algún</i>.</p>

						<p class="abstract">This squib concentrates on two cases of <i>some</i> used with a numeral, as in <i>some twenty people</i> and <i>thirty some people</i>, what I call the pre-numeral and post-numeral <i>some</i>s. I argue that the post-numeral construction is sensitive to the syntactic structure of numerals, while the pre-numeral construction is not. Both constructions involve selecting from among a set of numerical alternatives, but these alternatives differ in their source; in the pre-numeral case, the alternatives represent Lasersohnian pragmatic halo, but in the post-numeral case, they are conditioned by the syntax of the numeral through merger of a covert wh-word.</p>

						<p class="abstract">In this paper I provide a formal analysis of the English hedge sorta, concentrating on its use with verb phrases. I bring to light new data showing how sorta can hedge the direct object of creation verbs and some intensional verbs without combining with the direct object directly, and that the ability to hedge a direct object from a distance is conditioned by verb type and the type of determiner with the direct object. I build an analysis using Morzycki (2011)'s alternative semantics implementation of the pragmatic halos of Lasersohn (1999).</p>

						<p class="abstract">In this paper I provide an analysis of the English hedges sorta and kinda, which show a cross-categorial distribution and can induce gradability with non- gradable predicates. I analyze sorta and kinda as degree words and provide a formal analysis of their behavior. With gradable predicates, these behavior similar to other degree words such as very, but with non-gradable predicates, a mismatch of logical type forces the predicate to typeshift to a gradable type, making available a degree argument that represents imprecision. The analysis is developed using Morzycki’s (2011) implementation of Lasersohnian pragmatic halos (Lasersohn 1999), and presents a case study in how gradability may be coerced from non- gradable expressions.</p>
